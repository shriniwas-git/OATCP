Approach
Explanation:

The approach to solving the patching array problem revolves around identifying the smallest sum ('miss') in the range [0, n] that might be missing from the given array. We maintain the invariant that we can build all sums in the range [0, miss), and then extend this range as needed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

Initialization:

We start by initializing 'miss' as 1, indicating the smallest sum that might be missing initially.
'added' variable keeps track of the count of numbers added to the array to patch the missing sums.
'i' is an index variable used to iterate through the given array.
Building Sums:

We iterate through the array and check if the current element is less than or equal to 'miss'.
If the current element is within the range [0, miss), we can include it in the sums we can build. We update 'miss' by adding the current element to it.
If the current element is greater than 'miss' or we have iterated through the entire array, we need to add a new number to the array to patch the missing sum. To maximize the reach, we add 'miss' itself to the array. We double the 'miss' value to cover the range [0, miss + miss).
Loop Termination:

We continue this process until 'miss' exceeds the target sum 'n'.
Result:

The number of elements added to the array to patch the missing sums is stored in the 'added' variable.
