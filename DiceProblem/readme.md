Algorithmic Explanation:

Define a Recursive Function:

Define a function, let's call it countWays(target, currentSum), which calculates the number of ways to reach the target sum starting from the current sum.

Base Cases:

If the current sum equals the target sum, return 1, indicating that we have found one way to reach the target.
If the current sum exceeds the target sum, return 0, indicating that it's not possible to reach the target with the current sum.
Recursion:

Iterate over all possible outcomes of rolling the dice (from 1 to 6).
For each outcome, recursively call countWays(target, currentSum + outcome) to calculate the number of ways to reach the target starting from the updated sum.
Combine Results:

Sum up the results from all possible outcomes of the dice rolls. Each recursive call represents a different possible outcome.
Memoization (Optional):

To optimize performance, you can use memoization to store and reuse previously computed results. This prevents redundant calculations for the same sum.
Return Total Ways:

Return the total number of ways obtained from all possible dice rolls.
Example:

Let's say the target sum is 5. Here's how the function works:

Start with countWays(5, 0) where 5 is the target sum and 0 is the initial sum.
Roll the dice with outcomes 1 to 6:
For each outcome, recursively call countWays(target, currentSum + outcome).
If the current sum reaches the target sum, return 1.
If the current sum exceeds the target sum, return 0.
Sum up the results from all outcomes to get the total number of ways to reach the target sum.
