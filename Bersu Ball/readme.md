Approach:

Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:

Sort the arrays of boys' heights and girls' heights in non-decreasing order.
Initialize a 2D DP array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) where n is the size of the boys' array and m is the size of the girls' array. Initialize all elements of dp to 0.
Use dynamic programming to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
Iterate over the sorted arrays of boys' and girls' heights using nested loops.
If the absolute difference between the heights of the current boy and girl is at most 1:
Increment the current DP cell by 1 plus the value of the DP cell diagonally preceding it.
Otherwise, set the current DP cell to the maximum of the values in the adjacent cells.
Return the value in the bottom-right corner of the DP array, modulo 1000000007.
Algorithm:

Sort the arrays of boys' heights and girls' heights.
Initialize a 2D DP array dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) where n is the size of the boys' array and m is the size of the girls' array. Initialize all elements of dp to 0.
Iterate over the sorted arrays of boys' and girls' heights using nested loops:
- For each pair of heights boys[i] and girls[j]:
- If the absolute difference between boys[i] and girls[j] is at most 1:
- Increment dp[i+1][j+1] by 1 plus the value of dp[i][j].
- Otherwise, set dp[i+1][j+1] to the maximum of dp[i][j+1] and dp[i+1][j].
Return dp[n][m] modulo 1000000007 as the maximum number of pairs formed.

This dynamic programming approach efficiently calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed by considering all possible pairs of boys' and girls' heights and using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum count of valid pairs. Finally, it returns the count of pairs modulo 1000000007.
