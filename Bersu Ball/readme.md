Approach:

Sort the Arrays: Sort the arrays of boys' heights and girls' heights in non-decreasing order.

Count Pairs:

Initialize variables to track the number of pairs formed (pairs), and two pointers (i for boys and j for girls) initialized to 0.
Iterate over both arrays simultaneously using the two pointers.
    If the absolute difference between the heights of the current boy and girl is at most 1, increment the pairs count and move both pointers to the next elements.
    If the height of the current boy is greater than the height of the current girl, move the girl's pointer to the next element.
    If the height of the current girl is greater than the height of the current boy, move the boy's pointer to the next element.
Return: Return the count of pairs modulo 1000000007.

Algorithm:

Sort the arrays of boys' heights and girls' heights.
Initialize pairs to 0 and pointers i and j to 0.
While both pointers are within their respective arrays:
    If the absolute difference between boys[i] and girls[j] is at most 1:
    Increment pairs.
    Move both pointers to the next elements.
    Otherwise, if boys[i] is greater than girls[j], move the girl's pointer to the next element.
    Otherwise, move the boy's pointer to the next element.
Return pairs modulo 1000000007 as the maximum number of pairs formed.
This approach efficiently finds the maximum number of pairs that can be formed by iterating over the sorted arrays of boys' and girls' heights and incrementing the pair count when the height difference condition is met. Finally, it returns the count of pairs modulo 1000000007.
