Approach:
This program sorts a given list of numbers in a way that forms the largest possible number when concatenated.

Algorithm:
Sorting:

Define a custom comparison function compare() that compares two numbers based on the concatenated string representation of their digits. The comparison is based on which combination results in a larger number when concatenated.
Sort the numbers using the custom comparison function.
Concatenation:

Concatenate the sorted numbers to form the largest possible number.
Output:

If the resulting number starts with '0', output '0' as it represents the largest possible number with the given digits.
Otherwise, output the formed number.
