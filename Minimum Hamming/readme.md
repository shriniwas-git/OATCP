Approach

The approach to calculating the total Hamming distance revolves around iterating through each bit position (from 0 to 31) and counting the number of set bits at that position across all elements in the given array. The total Hamming distance is then calculated by multiplying the count of set bits by the count of unset bits at each position and summing these values for all bit positions.

Explanation:

Initialization:

We start by initializing hammingdistance to 0, which will store the total Hamming distance.
We iterate through each bit position from 0 to 31.
For each bit position, we initialize setbits to 0, which will store the count of set bits at that position.

Calculating Hamming Distance:

We iterate through each element in the input array nums.
For each element, we right-shift it by the current bit position and perform a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check if the bit at that position is set.
If the bit is set, we increment the setbits counter for that position.

Updating Total Hamming Distance:

After counting the set bits for each element at the current bit position, we calculate the count of unset bits by subtracting the count of set bits from the total number of elements in the array (nums.size()).
We then multiply the count of set bits by the count of unset bits and add this product to the hammingdistance.
Loop Termination:

This process continues until we have iterated through all bit positions (from 0 to 31).

Result:

The total Hamming distance calculated is stored in the variable hammingdistance.
