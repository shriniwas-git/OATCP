Approach:
The provided code aims to determine a valid arrangement of pairs using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm while considering the directed relationships between elements.

Initialization:
The code initializes an adjacency map to represent the directed relationships between elements.
It defines a vector to store the pairs forming the relationships.

Depth-First Search (DFS):
The DFS function explores the graph starting from a given node, traversing through its adjacent nodes recursively.
During traversal, it adds the current node and its adjacent node to the result vector, ensuring a valid arrangement.

Valid Arrangement:
The validArrangement function constructs the adjacency map and calculates the indegree of each node.
It then initiates DFS from the appropriate starting node and reverses the result vector to ensure correct ordering.

Main Function:
The main function reads input from a file and processes it.
It checks if the size of the result vector is equal to the number of pairs. If not, it concludes that no valid arrangement is possible.
If a valid arrangement exists, it writes the pairs to the output file; otherwise, it writes "No valid arrangement possible".

Overall, this code efficiently determines a valid arrangement of pairs while considering the directed relationships between elements. If no valid arrangement is possible, it appropriately communicates this outcome.
