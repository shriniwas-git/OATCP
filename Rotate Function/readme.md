Approach:
Initialization:

Calculate the initial sum of all elements in the array.
Calculate the initial sum of products of indices and values.
Dynamic Programming:

Iterate over the array and consider each rotation as a subproblem.
    For each rotation, update the sum of products of indices and values by considering the effect of the rotation. This update can be calculated using the previous sum, the total sum of nums, and the last element at that rotation.
    Track the maximum sum encountered so far.
Return:

After iterating through all possible rotations, return the maximum sum found.
Algorithm:
Calculate the initial sum sum of all elements in the array nums.
Calculate the initial sum f1 of products of indices and values.
Initialize ans to f1.
Iterate over the array from index 1 to nums.size() - 1:
    Calculate the sum f2 of products of indices and values after rotation:
    f2 = f1 + sum - (nums.size()) * (last_element_at_that_rotation)
    Update ans to the maximum of ans and f2.
    Update f1 to f2.
Return ans as the maximum sum of products of indices and values after rotation.
