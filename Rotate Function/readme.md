Approach:

Initialization: Calculate the initial sum of all elements in the array and the sum of products of indices and values.

Rotation and Update:

For each rotation of the array:
Update the sum of products of indices and values by considering the effect of rotation.
Track the maximum sum encountered so far.
Return: Return the maximum sum found.

Algorithm:

Calculate the initial sum sum of all elements in the array.
Calculate the initial sum f1 of products of indices and values.
Initialize ans to f1.
Iterate over the array from index 1 to nums.size() - 1:
    Calculate the sum f2 of products of indices and values after rotation.
    which is given by previous_sum + total_sum_of_nums - (nums.size())*(last_element_at_that_rotation)
    Update ans to the maximum of ans and f2.
    Update f1 to f2.
Return ans as the maximum sum of products of indices and values after rotation.
This approach effectively rotates the array and updates the sum of products of indices and values after each rotation, keeping track of the maximum sum encountered. Finally, it returns the maximum sum found.
