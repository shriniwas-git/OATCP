Approach:
This program efficiently calculates the maximum number of ice creams that can be bought with a given amount of money using a greedy approach.

Algorithm:

Initialization:
Initialize variables and necessary data structures.

Input Processing:
Read the total number of ice creams (n) and their prices.

Ice Cream Purchase:
Sort the prices of the ice creams in ascending order.
Iterate through the sorted array of ice cream prices.
Deduct the price of each ice cream from the available amount until the amount becomes insufficient or all ice creams are bought.
Maintain a count of the number of ice creams bought.

Output:
Output the maximum number of ice creams that can be purchased within the given budget.
