generateSubsequences function:
Input: String word, integer maxLength, unordered set subsequences
Iterate len from 1 to maxLength:
Iterate start from 0 to n - len:
Create an empty string subsequence.
Initialize count to 0.
Iterate i from start to n - 1 or until count reaches len:
Append word[i] to subsequence.
Increment count.
Insert subsequence into subsequences.
assign function:
Input: Vector of strings words
Initialize an unordered map wtsf to store word-to-shortform mappings.
Initialize an unordered set usf to keep track of used shortforms.
Iterate through each word in words:
If the length of the word is less than or equal to 4:
Set the shortform of the word as itself in wtsf.
Insert the word into usf.
Otherwise:
Generate subsequences of length up to 4 for the word using generateSubsequences.
Iterate through each subsequence:
If the subsequence is not already used (not in usf):
Set the shortform of the word as the subsequence in wtsf.
Insert the subsequence into usf.
Break from the loop.
If a shortform for the word is not found:
Print a message indicating that no unique short form was found.
Return the wtsf map.
This algorithm outlines the process of assigning short forms to words based on their subsequences and ensures that each short form is unique.
