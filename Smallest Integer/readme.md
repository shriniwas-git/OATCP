Approach
The approach to solving this problem centers around the efficient utilization of a stack data structure. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

Initialization:
The solution starts by initializing an empty stack to store elements.
The first element of the input sequence is pushed onto the stack.
It is assumed that the first element is non-zero, as per the problem statement.

Processing:
As the algorithm progresses through the input sequence, it compares each element with the top element of the stack.
If the current element is smaller than the top element of the stack, indicating a potential reduction in the number formed, the algorithm pops elements from the stack.
The popping continues until one of the following conditions is met:
The stack becomes empty.
The top element of the stack is less than or equal to the current element.
The number of elements to be removed (denoted by 'k') becomes zero.
During this process, the algorithm also keeps track of the number of elements removed ('k').

Optimization:
While processing, if the stack becomes empty, and the current element is '0', it's not pushed onto the stack. This step ensures that leading zeros are not considered in the final result.
Additionally, if there are remaining elements to be removed after processing the entire sequence, the algorithm removes them from the end of the result.

Result Generation:
After processing the entire input sequence, the remaining elements in the stack constitute the final result.
If the resulting string is empty, indicating all elements were removed, the result is set to '0'.
Conversion to Integer:

Finally, the resulting string is converted to an integer representation.
This integer represents the minimized number after removing 'k' elements while preserving the relative order of the remaining elements.
