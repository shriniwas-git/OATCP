Approach:

Initialization: Initialize variables to track the current maximum product, previous maximum product, and previous minimum product.

Iterative Calculation:

Iterate over the array and calculate the maximum product considering three possibilities: current element alone, current element multiplied by previous maximum product, and current element multiplied by previous minimum product.
Update the current maximum product and previous minimum product accordingly.
Keep track of the maximum product encountered so far.
Return: Return the maximum product modulo 1000000007.

Algorithm:

If the array is empty, return 0.
Initialize p1 and p2 to the first element of the array.
Initialize res to the first element of the array.
Iterate over the array from index 1 to nums.size() - 1:
    Calculate the maximum product temp among three possibilities: current element alone, current element multiplied by p1, and current element multiplied by p2.
    Update p2 to the minimum of these three products.
    Update p1 to temp.
    Update res to the maximum of res and p1.
Return res modulo 1000000007 as the maximum product subarray.
This approach efficiently computes the maximum product subarray by considering each element and updating the maximum product accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum product modulo 1000000007.
